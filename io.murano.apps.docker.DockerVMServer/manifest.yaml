Description: |
 Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run
 distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight
 runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications
 and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components
 and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments.
